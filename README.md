# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-for-Supermarket-Data-Analysis
This project performs a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a supermarket dataset. It normalizes the data, calculates the correlation matrix, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, and projects the data onto the first two principal components. Additionally, a new dataset (Amiens) is also projected onto these components.
## Usage
1. Download the `supermarche.txt` dataset (ensure the file exists in the working directory).
2. Run the script in MATLAB or Octave to view the results and visualizations.
